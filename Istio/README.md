# Istio Fundamentals

## What is a Service Mesh?
A **service mesh** is an infrastructure layer that manages communication between microservices. It abstracts networking responsibilities, improving **security, traffic control, and observability**.

**Key Benefits:**
- Standardizes service-to-service communication
- Enhances security with **mTLS (mutual TLS)** and authentication
- Enables **dynamic traffic routing** (e.g., canary releases, A/B testing)
- Provides deep observability into service interactions

---

## Why Istio?
Without a service mesh, microservices communicate directly, which can lead to:
- **Lack of visibility** into service interactions
- **No built-in security** for encryption or authentication
- **Difficult traffic management** for blue-green deployments, retries, and failovers
- **Complex troubleshooting** for service failures

### **How Istio Solves These Problems:**
✔ **Decouples networking logic from applications**
✔ **Provides traffic routing and load balancing**
✔ **Enforces security policies using mTLS and RBAC**
✔ **Enhances observability with logs, metrics, and tracing**

## Istio Architecture: Control Plane vs. Data Plane

### **1️⃣ Data Plane (Handles service traffic)**
- Uses **Envoy** proxies as sidecars deployed alongside each service.
- Manages **traffic routing, load balancing, and security**.
- **Intercepts and modifies requests** based on Istio policies.

### **2️⃣ Control Plane (Manages configuration and policies)**
- **Istiod** (combines Pilot, Citadel, and Galley):
  - **Pilot**: Configures Envoy proxies for traffic control.
  - **Citadel**: Manages security (mTLS, identity, authentication).
  - **Galley** (Deprecated in Istio 1.8+): Used for configuration management.

## Key Istio Components

| Component   | Role |
|------------|------|
| **Envoy**  | Sidecar proxy for traffic control |
